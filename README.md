# Trading-Bytes

- A real-time application that displays real-time trading news and trader profiles. Derived from a similar app that displayed a list of 3000 Developers and their github profiles. 

- We keep it simple: no create views for adding news or trader profiles - just scrap everything from the internet and display it on the site.

# Concepts

1. **Webscrapping** 

- Get a list of trader profiles.
- Get a list of real-time trading news.

2. **Asynchronous Data Processing** 

- Django Channels & Celery Workers to facilitate actual real-time data display.
- Any other technology that would achieve the above.

3. **Microservices**

- Open up the project for contributors working on unique tech stacks and looking to make this application better.
- Make it easier to scale - as the project's needs grow.

4. **Containerization**

- Avoiding the age-old problem of it works on my machine.
- Make **3 above** as achievable as it should be.
